Dann ist es einfach funktional kaputt. 

## Motivation

Carriers restricting cellular data usage and drastically limiting the speed makes googling and surfing in general a source of
a pain when you exhausted your quota. I think there is room for improvement. 

## What this does

When one googles and then browses a website subsequently, a lot of unneccessary stuff is loaded over your poor
restricted bandwith onto your device. CSS, JS, images etc. from Google as well as from the website you wish to browse. 
This application first outsources the googling task to the server-side and second drastically minifies the rendered 
HTML so data that needs to be loaded onto your device is very slim. In return this means that it will look very spare
and not pretty at all. But it gets the job done if you only care about the textual content of a website.

## THIS IS FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY

*Do not use this on a public server. It is meant for personal use (mainly my own use) only.*
